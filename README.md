# Goal Tracker

A practice take-home assignment from Hackbright Academy

## The Challenge

Build a goal tracking app. It should allow users to view, save, and edit goals. Users should only be able to see their own goals. Use Firebase as your database, but all other technology is up to you. Given that this will have private user data, security is important.
